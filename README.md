A gas leakage detector is a device designed to detect the presence of potentially harmful or flammable gases in the air. These devices are commonly used in homes, industrial facilities, and commercial buildings to ensure the safety of occupants and prevent gas-related accidents. Gas leaks can be dangerous because many gases are odorless and colorless, making them difficult to detect without specialized equipment

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or ESP8266/ESP32)
Wi-Fi or Ethernet Module (if not built into the microcontroller)
Power Supply (e.g., batteries or a power adapter)
IoT Platform or Cloud Service (e.g., Arduino IoT, AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, or similar)
Relay (for controlling external devices like alarms or shut-off valves)
Buzzer or LED (for local alerts)
Smartphone or computer for monitoring and control
